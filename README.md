SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT USING BLOCKCHAIN

1. Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of managing the flow of goods and services to and from a business, including every step involved in turning raw materials and components into final products and getting them to the ultimate customer. 
2. Integration, operations, purchasing, and distribution are the four elements of the supply chain that work together to establish a path to competition that is both cost-effective and competitive.
3. We mainly focus on customers and sellers where the product details will be displayed i.e. when it is manufactured.
